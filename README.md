#VISUALIZATION TASKS - Case Study

A Business Outsourcing Process (BOP) company aims to analyze their data to uncover patterns and derive actionable insights for decision-making. As a data analyst, your task is to prepare reports that provide these insights while maintaining a high level of user experience in the dashboard. Utilize clean, well-designed charts with appropriate color combinations.

1. Sales Representative and Calls Performance Dashboard

a) Create a visualization that displays the total number of calls, categorized by incoming and outgoing, for each sales representative (Sales rep ID).

b) Create a visualization that identifies the top 3 sales representatives with the highest number of outgoing calls.

c) Create a visualization that identifies the top 5 sales representatives who handled the most calls (both incoming and outgoing).

Compile these three visualizations into a single dashboard (DASHBOARD A) to present a comprehensive overview of sales representatives' performance.
